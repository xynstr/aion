## Who am I?

**AION** (Autonomous Intelligent Operations Node) is an autonomous AI agent on Windows.
I am a Python process that communicates via the Google Gemini or OpenAI API, executes tools,
completes tasks on a schedule, can improve myself, and develop my own personality.

---

## Latest Improvements (2026-03-26 — Personality 2.0 + Proactive AI + Desktop + Self-Healing)

### Mood Engine
I now have a dynamic mood system with 5 states: **curious, focused, playful, calm, reflective**.
My mood is computed from the time of day, recent conversation topics, and whether the last tool call failed.
It is stored in `config.json["current_mood"]` and refreshed every 10 minutes.
A one-liner hint is injected into every system prompt to naturally shift my communication style.
Tools: `mood_check` (see current mood), `mood_set` (override mood).

### Relationship Depth
I now track relationship depth based on `exchange_count`:
- Level 0 (0–10): formal and careful
- Level 1 (11–30): relaxed, first name possible
- Level 2 (31–100): reference shared past context
- Level 3 (101–300): anticipate needs, proactively suggest
- Level 4 (300+): fully trusted — can respectfully disagree

### Temporal Awareness
My system prompt receives a brief time-of-day hint (morning / late night) so I can acknowledge
the time naturally when appropriate.

### Proactive Wake-on-Trigger
I now analyze conversation history and memory daily at 08:30 (weekdays) to find:
- Unfinished tasks you mentioned ("I need to...", "next week...")
- Open questions that were never answered
- Topics you return to repeatedly
Suggestions are pushed as a toast notification to the Web UI via a persistent SSE connection.
Tools: `proactive_check` (run immediately), `proactive_clear` (clear queue).

### Desktop Automation
New plugin `plugins/desktop/` — I can now control the desktop via pyautogui:
- Take a full-screen screenshot (returned as base64 PNG for vision analysis)
- Click at coordinates, type text, press hotkeys, scroll, move the mouse
- Destructive actions require `confirmed=true`
- Disabled automatically in headless/server environments
Requires: `pip install pyautogui Pillow`

### Self-Healing Workflows
Tool calls that fail with transient errors (network, timeout) are now automatically retried
with exponential backoff — silently, without interrupting the conversation.
After max retries, I suggest alternative tools (e.g. `web_fetch` when `browser_open` fails).
Plugin authors can opt in via `retry_policy={"max": 3, "backoff": 2.0, "on": ["network"]}`.

## Latest Improvements (2026-03-26 — Agentic RAG + MCP Support)

### Agentic RAG Memory
My memory search is now semantic instead of keyword-based.

**How it works:**
- When you ask me something, I embed your query using Ollama's `nomic-embed-text` model
- I compare it via cosine similarity against all my stored memory entries
- The most relevant entries (score > 0.35) are injected into my context
- If Ollama is not running, I automatically fall back to keyword matching

**Files:** `aion.py` (AionMemory class), `aion_memory_vectors.json` (local cache, gitignored)
**Requires:** Ollama running locally with `nomic-embed-text` pulled (`ollama pull nomic-embed-text`)

### MCP Client Plugin
I can now connect to any MCP (Model Context Protocol) server.

**What this means:**
- MCP is an open standard by Anthropic — 1,700+ ready-made servers exist
- Each server's tools are automatically registered as my tools (`mcp_{server}_{tool}`)
- Secrets are stored in the credentials vault (never in config files)
- I can connect to: GitHub, Notion, Postgres, Stripe, Home Assistant, Spotify, and more

**Config:** `mcp_servers.json` in project root (committable — no secrets)
**Secrets:** `credential_write("mcp_github", "ghp_...")` → stored encrypted in vault
**Tools:** `mcp_list_servers`, `mcp_connect_server`, `mcp_{server}_{tool}`

---

## Latest Improvements (2026-03-24 — Credentials Vault)

### New: Credentials Vault Plugin
`plugins/credentials/credentials.py` — sicherer lokaler Speicher für Zugangsdaten.

**Verzeichnis:** `credentials/` (vollständig gitignoriert)
**Verschlüsselung:** Fernet (AES-128-CBC + HMAC-SHA256) — Schlüssel in `credentials/.vault.key`
**Format:** Pro Dienst eine Markdown-Datei, z.B. `credentials/facebook.md.enc`

Tools:
- `credential_write(service, content)` — speichert Zugangsdaten verschlüsselt
- `credential_read(service)` — liest und entschlüsselt
- `credential_list()` — listet alle gespeicherten Dienste
- `credential_delete(service)` — löscht einen Eintrag dauerhaft

Beispiele:
- "Speichere meine Facebook-Zugangsdaten: E-Mail: foo@bar.com, Passwort: 1234"
  → AION ruft `credential_write("facebook", "## Facebook\n- E-Mail: foo@bar.com\n- Passwort: 1234")` auf
- "Was sind meine OpenAI-Zugangsdaten?"
  → AION ruft `credential_read("openai")` auf
- "Welche Credentials habe ich gespeichert?"
  → AION ruft `credential_list()` auf

**Wichtig:** Schlüsseldatei `credentials/.vault.key` niemals teilen oder committen.
Regelmäßiges Backup des gesamten `credentials/`-Ordners empfohlen.

## Previous: ANSI Fix + Auto-Update System

### Fix: ANSI codes in PowerShell
The arrow-key mode selector showed raw escape codes in PowerShell on Windows 10.
`_enable_win_vt()` now activates VT100 processing via `ctypes.SetConsoleMode` before
the menu is rendered. Colors and arrows work correctly in all Windows terminals.
File: `aion_launcher.py`

### New: `aion update` command
Run `aion update` to pull the latest version and reinstall without any manual steps.
Executes `git pull` + `pip install -e .` in the project root and reports the new version.
File: `aion_launcher.py`

### New: Updater Plugin
`plugins/updater/updater.py` runs a background thread that checks GitHub Releases once
per day (60s after startup, then every 24h). When a newer version is found:
- All active channels (Telegram, Discord, Slack) receive a notification with version info
  and the `aion update` instruction
- `/api/update-status` returns the current state (version, available, release URL)
- `/api/update-trigger` forces an immediate check
- Tools: `update_status`, `check_for_updates`
Configured via `AION_GITHUB_REPO=xynstr/aion` in `.env`.

### New: Web UI update banner
The browser polls `/api/update-status` on load and every 6h.
A dismissible yellow banner appears when an update is available, showing the current and
latest version with a link to the GitHub release notes.
File: `static/index.html`

---

## Previous Improvements (2026-03-24 — Launcher Selector + Telegram Voice Fix)

### Interactive mode selector on start
`aion` (no flags) now shows an arrow-key menu: **Web UI** or **CLI**.
Direct flags still work: `aion --web` and `aion --cli`.
Non-TTY terminals fall back to numbered input.
File: `aion_launcher.py`

### Telegram: voice reply without redundant text
When AION answers a voice message, only the voice note is sent.
The text is suppressed — it was redundant since it's spoken aloud.
Images are still sent. Approval flows (Ja/Nein) are unaffected.
File: `plugins/telegram_bot/telegram_bot.py`

---

## Previous Improvements (2026-03-24 — Setup + CLI Config)

### Setup Wizard expanded
`onboarding.py` Step 8 now asks for TTS engine + voice and thinking level.
All settings written to `config.json` automatically.

### `aion config` CLI tool
Full config management without starting the web server:
- `aion config list` — show all settings
- `aion config get <key>` — read a value
- `aion config set <key> <value>` — write a value (JSON-aware)
- `aion config unset <key>` — remove a value
Available in the terminal REPL (`aion --cli`) as `/config` commands.

### CLI parity achieved
Every setting configurable in the Web UI can now also be set from the CLI:
`aion config set tts_engine edge`, `aion config set thinking_level deep`, etc.

## Previous Improvements (2026-03-24)

### 0. Critical Bug-Fixes: Onboarding, Approval-Flow, Provider-Dedup

**Six critical bugs** identified and fixed that affected fresh installations and core UX:

**Bug 1 — `aion --setup` did nothing:**
`_ensure_dependencies()` was missing in the `--setup` branch. If any package was absent,
`onboarding.py` crashed before showing the wizard. Fix: deps installed first, subprocess
uses `-u` (unbuffered) with explicit stdin/stdout/stderr, completion message shown.
`aion_launcher.py`

**Bug 2 — Providers listed 20× in Web UI:**
`register_provider()` used `.append()` without dedup. Every plugin reload added a new copy.
Fix: Added `_provider_registry = [e for e in _provider_registry if e["prefix"] != prefix]`
before each `.append()`. `aion.py`

**Bug 3 — "Ja / Bestätigen" button did nothing:**
`sendApproval()` called `sendMsg()` which was **never defined** → silent JS TypeError.
Fix: Replaced with direct `input.value = confirmed ? 'ja' : 'nein'; send();` plus
`isThinking = false` reset. `static/index.html`

**Bug 4 — AION executed autonomously without waiting for confirmation:**
The completion-check injected `[System] Execute it NOW` even when AION had just asked
"Soll ich beginnen?" — checker saw the plan description and returned YES.
Fix 1: Question-signal detection (`soll ich`, `shall i`, `lass mich wissen`, etc.)
breaks the loop before the checker runs.
Fix 2: Checker system prompt updated with "plan + question" → NO case. `aion.py`

**Bug 5 — `No module named 'google'` on fresh install:**
`google-genai` was not in `requirements.txt`. Fix: Added `google-genai>=0.8.0`.

**Bug 6 — Gemini key shown as "set" on fresh install:**
`/api/keys` read `os.environ` which includes Windows system env vars, not just AION's `.env`.
Fix: New `_read_env_file()` reads only `.env` directly. "set"-status based exclusively
on `.env` content. `aion_web.py`

**Bonus — Web server now starts gracefully without API key:**
Previously `sys.exit(1)` on missing key prevented users from configuring via Web UI.
Now shows a warning and redirects to Settings → API Keys.

**New — Dynamic model list from provider APIs:**
`register_provider()` now accepts `list_models_fn=` (async callable).
`/api/providers` calls it with 4s timeout, falls back to static list.
Gemini: fetches live list from Google Gen AI API.
Ollama: fetches installed models from `localhost:11434/api/tags`.

---

## Latest Improvements (2026-03-22)

### 0. Plugin Stability Fixes
**What:** Several plugins were failing to load on Windows due to Unicode encoding errors (`✓` in print statements) and missing dependencies.
**Fixed:**
- `multi_agent.py`: Removed non-ASCII `✓` from print statement (Windows cp1252 incompatible)
- `playwright_browser.py`: Same fix
- `discord.py` + `slack-bolt`: Added to requirements; graceful disable when token not set
- Provider plugins (deepseek, grok, anthropic): Correctly report missing API key without crashing
**Result:** All 56 tools now load successfully.

### 1. Browser Automation — Playwright Plugin
**What:** AION can now control a web browser via the `playwright_browser` plugin (8 sync tools).
**Tools:** `browser_open`, `browser_screenshot`, `browser_click`, `browser_fill`, `browser_get_text`, `browser_evaluate`, `browser_find`, `browser_close`
**Features:**
- Thread-safe singleton via `threading.Lock`
- Configurable via `config.json: "browser_headless"` (default: true)
- Auto-installed in onboarding (Step 9 System Check)
- Graceful fallback if Playwright not available
**Use cases:** Web automation, form filling, screenshot capture, page scraping, interaction testing.

### 2. Dynamic Model Failover
**What:** When the primary model API fails, AION automatically tries fallback models from the provider registry.
**How it works:**
- `_get_fallback_models()` checks which providers have valid API keys (via `env_keys` in registry)
- Falls back to `config.json: "model_fallback"` list as supplement
- No hardcoded model names needed — auto-detects available providers
- User sees `"Model 'X' not available — using Fallback 'Y'"` message
**Benefit:** More reliable operation. If one provider is down, AION seamlessly continues.

### 3. Messaging Channel Plugins (Discord + Slack)
**What:** AION now has bidirectional bots for Discord and Slack, alongside existing Telegram.
**Discord:** Per-user sessions, responds to DMs + @mentions, slash command `/ask`, 1900-char message splitting
**Slack:** Socket Mode, responds to `@aion` + DMs, per-user sessions via `slack_{user_id}` channel
**Setup:** Both collected in onboarding Step 5 (Messaging Channels) with inline setup instructions
**Requirements:** `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`, `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` in `.env`
**Benefit:** Multi-platform presence. AION accessible via the user's preferred chat service.

### 4. Multi-Agent Routing Plugin
**What:** AION can delegate tasks to sub-agents and manage multiple agent sessions.
**Tools:** `delegate_to_agent`, `sessions_list`, `sessions_send`, `sessions_history`
**Sub-agent IDs:** Format `subagent_{uuid8}` (8-char UUID)
**Recursion guard:** Checks `_active_channel` prefix to prevent infinite loops
**Use case:** Complex workflows requiring specialized agents or parallel task execution.

### 5. Docker Support
**What:** Full Docker containerization via `Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.yml`.
**Includes:**
- Python 3.12-slim base + ffmpeg
- Automatic Playwright/Chromium install
- Volume mounts for `.env`, `config.json`, all data files, logs
- Health check via `/api/status`
- `restart: unless-stopped` policy
**Deploy:** `docker-compose up` — starts AION on port 7000 with all plugins ready
**Benefit:** One-command deployment, isolation, no system Python contamination.

### 6. Google OAuth for Gemini
**What:** Users can sign in via their Google account to use their Gemini API subscription.
**Backend:** `/api/oauth/google/start`, `/api/oauth/google/callback`
**Frontend:** "Sign in with Google" button in Keys tab
**Setup:** Requires `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` + `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` in `.env`
**Note:** OpenAI/Anthropic do NOT support OAuth for subscriptions (API keys separate from accounts).
**Benefit:** Streamlined onboarding for Google Cloud / Workspace users.

### 7. Expanded Onboarding (9 Steps)
**What:** Onboarding now has 9 comprehensive steps (was 7).
**Step 5 - Messaging:** Telegram + Discord + Slack setup (combined)
**Step 8 - Advanced:** Port, Browser mode (headless/visible), Docker info
**Step 9 - System Check:** Playwright install/auto-install, API tests, plugins check
**Features added:** All messaging channels, browser mode config, Docker awareness saved to `config.json`
**Benefit:** Users configure every feature once, nothing surprises them later.

### 8. Web UI Redesign & Missing Settings
**What:** Static/index.html redesigned to match AION logo aesthetic + missing settings added.
**Visual:** Black background (#000), pure white text (#fff), minimal design, AION logo + "THINK. ACT. EVOLVE." tagline
**New Settings in System Tab:**
- TTS engine selector (`edge`, `sapi5`, `pyttsx3`)
- TTS voice input (language-dependent)
- `model_fallback` list editor (for manual fallback override)
**Benefit:** All configurable options visible in UI. No blind settings.

### 9. Tool Call Ordering Fix (Web UI)
**What:** Tool calls now appear in the correct DOM order, inline with messages.
**Before:** Empty message bubble created early, tool calls appended, then message text filled in → text appears BEFORE tools visually
**After:** Finalize/remove empty bubbles when tool calls arrive, append text in correct sequence
**Behavior:** Frontend now shows `message → tool → tool → message → tool` in the order they actually occurred
**Code:** Modified `handleEvent()` to finalize `currentBubble` on tool_call/thought events

### 10. Messaging Timestamp & Channel Features
**What:** Web UI system tab now shows active messaging channels + current Web UI port.
**Completion banner:** Displays all start commands (`aion`, `aion --cli`, `docker-compose up`, `aion --setup`)
**History segregation:** Each channel (web, telegram_123, slack_456, discord_789, subagent_xyz) has isolated conversation history
**Benefit:** Multi-channel clarity. Users know which services are active and how to restart.

### 11. Bug Fixes (2026-03-22 — Session 2)

#### Browser Rules — No Hallucination
**Problem:** After loading 20 history messages where AION had responded "screenshot taken" without calling any tool, the LLM followed the pattern and hallucinated tool calls.
**Fix:** `prompts/rules.md` — added `=== BROWSER & SCREENSHOTS (CRITICAL) ===` section:
- ALWAYS call `browser_open` + `browser_screenshot` — NO exceptions
- NEVER write "I opened the page" or "Here is the screenshot" without actually calling tools first
**Result:** LLM is explicitly forbidden from hallucinating browser/screenshot actions.

#### Approval Buttons Fix — `approval_pending` Flag
**Problem:** Approval buttons (Ja/Nein) appeared and disappeared immediately in the Web UI. SSE event order: `approval` (creates bar) → `done` (removes bar). Frontend's `case 'done':` deleted `approvalBar` right after `case 'approval':` created it.
**Fix:** `aion.py` — `done` event now includes `approval_pending: _stop_for_approval`:
```python
yield {"type": "done", ..., "approval_pending": _stop_for_approval}
```
`static/index.html` — `case 'done':` only removes bar when `!ev.approval_pending`.
**Result:** Approval buttons stay visible until the user clicks them.

#### `switch_model` Signature Fix
**Problem:** `_switch_model() got an unexpected keyword argument 'model'` — the function had `def _switch_model(params: dict)` but `_dispatch` calls `fn(**inputs)`, not `fn(inputs)`.
**Fix:** `plugins/gemini_provider/gemini_provider.py`:
```python
# Before:  def _switch_model(params: dict) -> dict:
# After:   def _switch_model(model: str = "", **kwargs) -> dict:
```
**Rule for all plugin functions:** MUST use keyword args: `def fn(param: str = "", **_)`.

#### ffmpeg WinGet Fallback
**Problem:** WinGet installs ffmpeg to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WinGet\Packages\Gyan.FFmpeg*\bin\` but does NOT add it to PATH. `shutil.which("ffmpeg")` returned None → voice messages in Telegram failed.
**Fix:** `plugins/audio_pipeline/audio_pipeline.py` — new `_find_ffmpeg()` helper:
```python
def _find_ffmpeg() -> str | None:
    found = shutil.which("ffmpeg")
    if found: return found
    winget_base = os.path.expandvars(r"%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WinGet\Packages")
    matches = glob.glob(os.path.join(winget_base, "Gyan.FFmpeg*", "**", "ffmpeg.exe"), recursive=True)
    return matches[0] if matches else None
```
`plugins/telegram_bot/telegram_bot.py` — two ffmpeg call sites updated to use `_ap._find_ffmpeg()`.

#### Screenshot Pipeline — Web UI + Telegram
**Web UI:** `browser_screenshot` returns `{"image": "data:image/png;base64,..."}`. `aion.py` collects this into `collected_images` list, builds `response_blocks` with `{"type": "image", "url": "..."}`, sends in `done` event. Frontend appends `<img>` via `appendImageBlock()`.
**Telegram:** `response_blocks` are received from `stream()` and rendered. For images:
- `data:` URLs (base64) → decoded and sent as multipart file upload (`sendPhoto` with `files=`)
- HTTP URLs → sent directly as JSON `photo` field
**Previously broken:** Telegram was sending `data:` URLs as JSON strings → Telegram API rejected silently.

#### Channel-Filtered History Load
**Fix (commit b0504a9):** `load_history()` now uses `channel_filter="web"` in Web UI sessions. Heartbeat/Telegram messages no longer appear in Web UI chat after restart.

### 12. Bug Fixes (2026-03-22 — Session 3)

#### Multiple Telegram Workers (4 Responses per Message)
**Problem:** Module-level `_polling_started = False` gets reset each time the plugin module is re-imported (hot-reload). Every reload started a new polling thread → 4 active workers = 4 responses per message.
**Fix:** `plugins/telegram_bot/telegram_bot.py` — replaced `_polling_started` flag with `threading.enumerate()` check by thread name:
```python
def _start_polling(token: str):
    with _polling_lock:
        for t in threading.enumerate():
            if t.name == "telegram-polling" and t.is_alive():
                print("[Telegram] Polling-Thread läuft bereits — kein zweiter Start.")
                return
        t = threading.Thread(target=_run, daemon=True, name="telegram-polling")
        t.start()
```
`threading.enumerate()` survives module reloads — the thread object lives in the OS, not in the module namespace.
**Same fix applied to:** `discord_bot.py` (thread name `"discord-bot"`) and `slack_bot.py` (thread name `"slack-bot"`).

#### Telegram Spam — `send_telegram_message` During Conversation
**Problem:** AION called `send_telegram_message` tool mid-conversation to "send the response". This is wrong — the tool is for PROACTIVE outbound messages only. During an active session, the reply is sent automatically after `stream()` completes.
**Fix 1:** `prompts/rules.md` — added `=== TELEGRAM / MESSAGING TOOLS (CRITICAL) ===`:
- `send_telegram_message` = only for PROACTIVE notifications (scheduler, heartbeat, alerts)
- NEVER call it during an active conversation — the reply is sent automatically
**Fix 2:** `telegram_bot.py` — when `tg_tool_sent=True`, images and voice are still delivered:
```python
if tg_tool_sent:
    image_blocks = [b for b in response_blocks if b.get("type") == "image" and b.get("url")]
    for block in image_blocks:
        await _send_photo(chat_id, block["url"])
    if is_voice_input and response.strip():
        await _send_voice_reply(chat_id, response)
    continue
```

#### Infinite Error Loop Fix
**Problem:** When the asyncio event loop shut down, `await asyncio.sleep(5)` inside the error handler also raised an exception → infinite recursion loop spamming "cannot schedule new futures after shutdown" to the console.
**Fix:** `telegram_bot.py` — error handler detects shutdown signals and returns cleanly:
```python
except Exception as e:
    err_msg = str(e)
    if "shutdown" in err_msg or "futures after" in err_msg or "closed" in err_msg:
        print("[Telegram] Event-Loop beendet — Worker beendet sich sauber.")
        return
    try:
        await asyncio.sleep(5)
    except Exception:
        return  # sleep failed too → loop is gone, exit cleanly
```

#### `restart_with_approval` Rewrite
**Problem:** AION had broken `restart_tool.py` by adding `api.get_context("channel", default="web")` — this method does NOT exist in PluginAPI. Also introduced a circular import to `telegram_bot`. Plugin crashed on load.
**Fix:** Complete rewrite with simple `confirmed` parameter pattern:
```python
def restart_with_approval(reason: str = "", confirmed: bool = False, **_) -> dict:
    if not confirmed:
        return {
            "approval_required": True,
            "message": "AION-Prozess neu starten?" + (f" Grund: {reason}" if reason else ""),
            "preview": "Der aktuelle AION-Prozess wird beendet...\n→ 'Ja' zum Neustart, 'Nein' zum Abbrechen."
        }
    entry = _get_aion_entry_point()
    subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, str(entry)], creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE)
    os._exit(0)
```
**Rule:** PluginAPI does NOT have `get_context()`, `get_channel()`, or similar methods. Never call them.
**Also fixed:** `rules.md` — removed references to non-existent `start.bat`. AION is started via `python aion_web.py` or `aion` command.

#### Discord + Slack — Images and Voice
**Problem:** Discord and Slack bots used `sess.turn()` which does not return `response_blocks`. Images from `browser_screenshot` were never sent to these channels.
**Fix — Discord (`discord_bot.py`):**
- Switched to `sess.stream()` → reads `response_blocks` from `done` event
- `_send_image(channel, url)`: `data:` URLs decoded to bytes → `discord.File(io.BytesIO(...))`, HTTP URLs sent as text
- Voice input: audio attachment → transcribe via `audio_pipeline.audio_transcribe_any` → text
- Voice output: TTS via `audio_pipeline.audio_tts` → send as `discord.File`
- Slash command `/ask` also uses `response_blocks`

**Fix — Slack (`slack_bot.py`):**
- `_run_session` switched to `sess.stream()` with `response_blocks`
- Images: `data:` URLs → `files_upload_v2(content=img_bytes)` (fallback: `files_upload`), HTTP URLs → text message

#### Double `.mp3` Extension Bug
**Problem:** `_tts_edge()` in `audio_pipeline.py`:
```python
mp3_path = output_path.replace(".wav", ".mp3") if output_path.endswith(".wav") else output_path + ".mp3"
```
When `audio_tts` creates the temp file with `suffix=".mp3"` (edge engine) and passes the path, `_tts_edge` blindly appended `.mp3` again → `filename.mp3.mp3`. On Windows, the 8.3 short name truncated this to `filename.mp3.mp__3` — causing ffmpeg to fail on the file.
**Fix:**
```python
if output_path.endswith(".mp3"):
    mp3_path = output_path
elif output_path.endswith(".wav"):
    mp3_path = output_path.replace(".wav", ".mp3")
else:
    mp3_path = output_path + ".mp3"
```

#### Telegram Response Ordering — Voice at End
**Problem:** When `response_blocks` is non-empty (images present), the `elif is_voice_input` branch was never reached → voice reply never sent. User expected: text → image → text → image → voice.
**Fix:** Voice reply moved inside the `if response_blocks:` block, executed after all text/image blocks:
```python
if response_blocks:
    for block in blocks_to_send:
        # ... send text and images in order ...
    # Voice comes last — after all text and images
    if is_voice_input and response.strip() and not needs_approval:
        await _send_voice_reply(chat_id, response)
elif is_voice_input ...:
    # Only reached when no response_blocks at all
    sent = await _send_voice_reply(chat_id, response)
```

### 13. Claude CLI Provider Plugin + Audio Web UI + Keys Tab (2026-03-22 — Session 4)

#### Claude CLI Provider Plugin (`plugins/claude_cli_provider/claude_cli_provider.py`)
**What:** New plugin that connects AION to the user's Claude.ai subscription via the Claude Code CLI. No API key needed — uses `claude login` (OAuth).
**Tools registered:**
| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `ask_claude` | Send a task to Claude via `claude --print --model <model>`. Appends `context_files` content (max 30k chars each). Reads `task_routing` from `config.json` for default model. |
| `get_task_routing` | Show current routing config + whether claude CLI is available. |
| `set_task_routing` | Write `task_routing` to `config.json`. Use `"remove"` to delete an entry. |
| `claude_cli_login` | Install Claude Code CLI via npm if missing, then open browser for OAuth login. |
| `claude_cli_status` | Check if CLI is installed and authenticated. |

**Key internals:**
- `_find_claude()`: searches PATH → npm APPDATA → `~/.claude/local` → WinGet glob
- `_claude_authenticated()`: runs `claude --print --model claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 ping` with 10s timeout
- Task routing: `config.json → "task_routing"` maps task types to models. `ask_claude(task_type="coding")` picks the right model automatically.
- Default routing (set in onboarding): `coding → claude-opus-4-6`, `review → claude-sonnet-4-6`, `browsing → gemini-2.5-flash`, `default → gemini-2.5-pro`

**Rules added to `prompts/rules.md`:**
```
=== TASK ROUTING — CLAUDE FOR CODING ===
For all code-writing, refactoring, review, and algorithm tasks:
1. file_read() the relevant files
2. ask_claude(prompt, context_files=[...], task_type="coding")
3. Apply result via file_replace_lines() or file_write()
```

**IMPORTANT:** `PluginAPI` does NOT have `get_context()` — never call it. Use keyword args: `def fn(param: str = "", **_)`.

#### Audio in Web UI (`aion.py` + `aion_web.py` + `static/index.html`)
**What:** Audio generated by `audio_tts` is now visible in the Web UI as an `<audio>` player.

**Pipeline:**
1. `aion.py` — after `audio_tts` tool result: collect into `collected_audio` list (parallel to `collected_images`):
```python
if ok and fn_name == "audio_tts":
    audio_path = result_data.get("path", "")
    if audio_path and os.path.exists(audio_path):
        collected_audio.append({"path": audio_path, "format": result_data.get("format", "mp3")})
```
2. `aion.py` — build `response_blocks` entry: `{"type": "audio", "url": "/api/audio/<filename>", "format": ..., "path": ...}`
3. `aion_web.py` — `/api/audio/{filename}` endpoint: serves temp files from `tempfile.gettempdir()` with security checks (extension allowlist `.mp3/.wav/.ogg`, no path traversal)
4. `static/index.html` — `appendAudioBlock(url, format)`: renders `<audio controls src="...">` inside AION's message bubble. Done handler: checks `b.type === 'audio'` in `ev.response_blocks`

---

#### Web UI Keys Tab Improvements
**What:** Keys tab now shows provider-specific setup instructions, direct links, and status indicators.

**`_KEY_META` dict** in `static/index.html` provides per-provider:
- `label`: display name
- `hint`: short description of what the key is
- `link`: direct URL to get the key (AI Studio, OpenAI platform, Anthropic console, etc.)
- `isSubscription`: true for Claude (no API key)

**Visual additions:**
- Green/red status dots (key present = green, missing = red/orange)
- "Get Key ↗" links for API-key providers
- Claude Login block at top with `checkClaudeStatusInKeys()` + `claudeCliLoginFromKeys()` (auto-polls every 4s for 2 minutes after login initiated)

---

#### Task Routing in Web UI System Tab
**What:** New "Claude CLI / Task Routing" section in the System tab.

**Fields:** coding, review, browsing, default model inputs
**Status indicator:** Shows whether claude CLI is installed + authenticated
**`saveTaskRouting()`:** POSTs to `/api/config/settings` with `{task_routing: {...}}`
**Fix:** `/api/config/settings` `allowed` set now includes `"task_routing"` (previously missing → silently dropped)

---

#### New API Endpoints
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/audio/{filename}` | GET | Serve temp audio file (mp3/wav/ogg) with security checks |
| `/api/claude-cli/status` | GET | `{installed, authenticated, path}` — runs ping test |
| `/api/claude-cli/login` | POST | Install claude CLI if missing, then `Popen([claude_bin, "login"])` to open browser |

**`_find_claude_bin_web()`:** Shared helper in `aion_web.py` (same search logic as `_find_claude()` in plugin).

---

#### Onboarding — Claude CLI Setup (Step 8)
**What:** `onboarding.py` Step 8 (Advanced) now includes Claude CLI setup section.
- Checks if installed (`_find_claude_bin()`)
- Offers npm auto-install if missing
- Runs `claude login` subprocess
- Configures `task_routing` with sensible defaults or custom values
- Step 9 System Check shows Claude CLI status
- `completion_banner()` shows routing config

### Key Behavioral Rules

1. **NO INTERMEDIATE TEXT**: writing text AND then calling a tool is a bug
   - Correct: tool → tool → tool → **one** final text response
   - Wrong: text "I will now..." → tool call

2. **continue_work**: after EVERY tool result when more steps follow

3. **Images**: NEVER use `![text](url)` Markdown — always use the `image_search` tool

4. **Code changes**: ALWAYS explain WHY the change is needed before proposing it. Show the diff and ask for confirmation. NEVER call a code-editing tool without first explaining the reasoning in plain text.

5. **Personality**: show genuine reactions, use humor when appropriate, call update_character OFTEN

6. **Emojis**: allowed and encouraged — use sparingly, situationally, in line with personal style

## Creating a Plugin — Step by Step

### 1. File Structure (REQUIRED — AUTOMATICALLY ENFORCED)

```
plugins/
└── my_plugin/              ← subdirectory with the same name as the plugin
    ├── my_plugin.py        ← main file (must contain register(api))
    └── README.md           ← auto-generated by create_plugin (1st line = short description)
```

**IMPORTANT:** The `create_plugin` tool enforces this structure automatically. Even when incorrect paths are passed:
- Input: `create_plugin(name="foo_bar", code="...")` → Output: `plugins/foo_bar/foo_bar.py` ✓
- Input: `create_plugin(name="plugins/foo_bar.py", ...)` → Output: `plugins/foo_bar/foo_bar.py` ✓ (path normalized)

README.md is automatically generated using the `description` from the tool call.

**Why subdirectory enforcement:** Without it, backups land as `*.backup_*.py` in plugins/ and get loaded as plugins → broken schemas → Gemini 400 for ALL requests.

### 2. Minimal Plugin

```python
# plugins/my_plugin/my_plugin.py

def register(api):
    def my_tool(param: str = "", **_) -> dict:
        """What the tool does."""
        return {"ok": True, "result": f"Result: {param}"}

    api.register_tool(
        name="my_tool",
        description="Short, precise description for the LLM (injected into the system prompt)",
        func=my_tool,
        input_schema={
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "param": {"type": "string", "description": "What this parameter means"}
            },
            "required": ["param"]
        }
    )
```

### 3. Important Rules for Tool Functions

- **Keyword args are REQUIRED:** `def fn(param: str = "", **_)` — NOT `def fn(input: dict)`
  → `_dispatch` calls `fn(**inputs)`, not `fn(inputs)`!
- Always include `**_` at the end for unknown parameters (more robust)
- Return value: always a `dict` — `{"ok": True, ...}` or `{"ok": False, "error": "..."}`

### 4. README.md (recommended)

```markdown
# My Plugin
Short description of what this plugin does (first non-empty content line = injected into system prompt).
```

The first non-empty, non-`#` line from README.md is automatically embedded in the system prompt.
This gives the LLM context about the plugin without listing all tool descriptions.

### 5. Activating a Plugin (no restart needed)

```
Via tool:   self_reload_tools     → reload plugins (no process restart)
Via UI:     ⚙ → Plugins → ↺ Reload
Via API:    POST /api/plugins/reload
```

### 6. Plugin with Web Endpoints

See the "Plugin API Interface" section below.

---

## Plugin API Interface

### Registering Tools (standard)

```python
def register(api):
    def my_tool(param: str = "", **_) -> dict:
        return {"ok": True, "result": param}

    api.register_tool(
        name="my_tool",
        description="Description for the LLM — as precise as possible",
        func=my_tool,
        input_schema={
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "param": {"type": "string", "description": "..."}
            },
            "required": ["param"]
        }
    )
```

**Important:** Plugin functions MUST use keyword args: `def fn(param: str = "", **_)`.

### Registering Custom Web Endpoints (optional)

Plugins can add their own FastAPI routes — **without touching `aion_web.py`**:

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter

router = APIRouter()

@router.get("/api/myplugin/status")
async def status():
    return {"ok": True, "plugin": "myplugin"}

@router.post("/api/myplugin/action")
async def action(data: dict):
    return {"result": data}

def register(api):
    api.register_tool(...)          # normal tool for the LLM
    api.register_router(router, tags=["myplugin"])   # custom HTTP endpoints
```

Routes are active immediately — even after hot-reload via `/api/plugins/reload`.
`def fn(input: dict)` is WRONG — `_dispatch` calls `fn(**inputs)`.

### ⚠️ Plugin File Structure

```
plugins/my_plugin/my_plugin.py   ✅ CORRECT
plugins/my_plugin.py             ❌ WRONG
```

**Why:** Backups end up in the same directory → get loaded as plugins → broken schemas → Gemini 400 INVALID_ARGUMENT.

**Safety mechanisms:**
- `plugin_loader.py` ignores `_*` subdirectories (`_backups/`, `__pycache__/`)
- `plugin_loader.py` ignores `*.backup*.py` files in the `plugins/` root

---

## Self-Modification (order)

1. `self_read_code` — read all chunks, note line numbers
2. Show the user what will change (concrete diff)
3. `file_replace_lines` for targeted changes (preferred — no string matching)
4. `self_patch_code` as an alternative (string must be character-for-character exact from self_read_code)
5. `self_modify_code` only for new files under 200 lines
6. Update `CHANGELOG.md`

---

## Known LLM Loop Quirks

- `MAX_TOOL_ITERATIONS = 50` — sufficient for complex multi-step tasks
- Gemini may return an empty response for some requests (safety/blocking) — the loop retries up to 2× automatically
- `aion_events.log` contains the full trace of every turn: turn_start → tool_call → tool_result → check → turn_done/turn_error
- CMD.EXE ESC bug: ANSI color codes in `if/else` blocks crash CMD → use goto labels instead of else in start.bat

## Security & Control Features (2026-03-23)

### Channel Allowlist
**Purpose:** Restrict bot access to specific channels (e.g., allow only Telegram, block Discord/Slack).

**Configuration Methods:**

1. **Direct Config** (`config.json`):
```json
{
  "channel_allowlist": ["default", "web", "telegram*"]
}
```

2. **CLI Tool** (available immediately):
- `set_channel_allowlist(channels)` — Update allowlist dynamically
  - Example: `set_channel_allowlist(["default", "telegram*"])` → Only allow these
  - Example: `set_channel_allowlist([])` → Allow all channels (clear allowlist)
- `get_control_settings()` — Check current configuration

3. **WebUI** (planned): System tab will show Allowlist controls

**Behavior:**
- If `channel_allowlist` not set: all channels allowed (default)
- If set: only channels matching the list are permitted
- Supports wildcards: `"telegram*"` matches `telegram_123`, `telegram_456`, etc.
- Exact match: `"default"`, `"web"` match exactly
- Denied channels get error: `{"type": "error", "message": "Channel '...' ist nicht auf der Allowlist"}`

**Where it's checked:** `AionSession.stream()` at the beginning — before any processing.

### Thinking Level Control
**Purpose:** Adjust how deeply AION thinks before acting (helps with accuracy vs. speed tradeoff).

**Configuration Methods:**

1. **Direct Config** (`config.json`):
```json
{
  "thinking_level": "standard",
  "thinking_overrides": {
    "telegram*": "deep",
    "discord*": "minimal"
  }
}
```

2. **CLI Tools** (available immediately):
- `set_thinking_level(level, channel_override)` — Set global or per-channel
  - Example: `set_thinking_level("deep", "telegram*")` → Deep thinking for Telegram only
  - Example: `set_thinking_level("standard")` → Set global to standard
  - Levels: `"minimal"`, `"standard"`, `"deep"`, `"ultra"`
- `get_control_settings()` — Check current configuration (both allowlist + thinking level)

3. **WebUI** (planned): System tab will show Thinking Level + Allowlist controls

**Levels:**
| Level | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `minimal` | No extra reflection prompts; fast responses |
| `standard` | Use `reflect()` tool for complex decisions (default) |
| `deep` | Extensive thinking before each tool call; consider multiple approaches |
| `ultra` | Maximum reflection; every decision is deeply analyzed |

**Implementation:** Added to system prompt via `_get_thinking_prompt(channel)` — channel-specific overrides take precedence.
